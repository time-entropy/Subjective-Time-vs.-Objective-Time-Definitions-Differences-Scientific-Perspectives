Time Definition and the Thermodynamic Arrow: A Unified Model of Entropy, Spacetime, and Irreversibility

This study revolutionizes our time definition by proposing a discrete framework where entropy evolves through multiplicative dynamics, inherently enforcing time irreversibility (ΔS>0) while preserving consistency with classical thermodynamics. The model unifies three scales of temporal change: thermodynamic time (global universe evolution), local spacetime transformations, and entropy-driven processes—offering a computational "entropy coordinate" to simulate physical systems.

Central breakthroughs include: (1) Deriving the arrow of time from fundamental quantum network interactions (Space Elementary Quantum, or SEQ), which also naturally explain light-speed invariance; (2) Framing dark energy and matter as emergent SEQ ground-state effects; (3) A falsifiable prediction of chiral asymmetry in positron/electron magnetic moments, testable in high-precision experiments.

The theory imposes three universal constraints for physical simulations: energy/momentum conservation, irreversible time evolution (ΔS≥0), and least-action path selection. By bridging thermodynamic time with quantum spacetime geometry, this work redefines entropy as the driver of time’s arrow, while proposing testable mechanisms for cosmic and quantum-scale phenomena.
